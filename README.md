# INST326-Project1


For the files in our project we have 3 files. One being instproject.py, which is the file that contains our code.  The second file is the csv file with menus that the python
code uses to run our code. The third file is the pytest file, which tests price function, the gluten function, and the foodtype function. 

For intructions on how to run the code, 

First: copy python3 instproject.py restaurants.csv in to the terminal for Mac....
copy python instproject.py restaurants.csv for Windows

Second: The code will give you a choice between 1-6.  This will then prompt another user input based on you choice of numbers 1-6.

Third: Type an option from the prompt that will give you the menu of whatever options fit the criteria of your previous choices. 

For instructions on interpretting the output of the program:

The output will be menus that fit the criteria of the choices you made previously.  For example, if you were to hit 3 for the 1-6 option, and then type "Big Mac", this would show you the menu for McDonald's, since the choice you made was a food item on the McDonald's menu. Another example using the numbers would be if you choice 6 for the 1-6 option, it would ask you to type a number that is the maximum amount of money you want to spend, so if you were to type 10, it would give you the menus for McDonald's, Chipotle, and Panda Express since those menus have items on them that are less than 10 dollars.

For the pytest file to run, you just type pytest test_instproject.py

We have no sources for this project, we used previous projects and lectures to write our code from scratch.
